# CraigsBot
### CraigsBot is an automated search bot for finding vehicles on Craigslist.

---

Given user-specified search parameters, CraigsBot will monitor Craiglist and find a vehicle that meets your requirements, then send you a direct message on Twitter with the details! 

CraigsBot was initially developed to compete with dealerships that quickly swoop up the best deals on the market and re-sell them with a markup, and it has been proven to work!

Personally, I hosted CraigsBot on a Raspberry Pi and was able to pick up a great deal within the same month!
